# CSC365 Assignment 2

## This extends Assignment 1 using persistent data structures and additional similarity analyses. It requires two programs.

### Loader

- For each of at least 100 URLs, create a persistent file-based B-Tree or Hash Table with word frequencies. (You may choose to store only a high-quality hash code rather than the word itself). Give each file a name based on its URL in order to locate it easily.
- Load each map with frequencies (possibly along with other data) extending or changing those in assignment 1 if applicable.
- Implement and use a fixed size buffer cache to reduce IO.
- Pre-categorize pages into 5 to 10 clusters using k-means, k-mediods, or a similar metric.

### Application

Extend Assignment 1 to display a category (cluster) and most similar site from the above data structures.
